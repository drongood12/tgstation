  - bugfix: "You can no longer hold yourself up with a gun"
  - bugfix: "Holding someone up with a gun will no longer cause a runtime when two people hold up the same person."
  - bugfix: "Having multiple people hold up the same person will no longer cause the victim's alerts to disappear when just one of the perpetrators stops holding them up."
