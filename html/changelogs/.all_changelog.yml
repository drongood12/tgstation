      damage, the burn has no infection, and the patient is fed.
  - balance: Hearts now decay slower, failing after roughly 6 minutes instead of 4.

      infinite wisdom have given the wayfinding pinpointer dispenser a personality
      lift in the hope of selling more pinpointers

      can still refund them at the dispenser though
  - code_imp: Moves some of the pointing code from the mob pointed() verb to an atom
      pointat() proc so everything can be made to point fingers at everything else
      and the animation is consistent. Now the wayfinding dispenser points like you
      do!

      needing to reconstruct the core, and will not get stuck in a state where attempting

      HUDs.
  Ryll/Shaps:

      skeletons and people with augmented heads are immune to this form of bullying.

      sensitive antennae. Lastly, hulks are extra rough with noogies, making them
      deal more damage.
  - rscadd: Added gunboots for admins
