  silicons:
  - refactor: projectiles now use a new hit detection system that doesn't rely on
      quirks in movement code to work, and is easier(?) to work with
  - refactor: pass_flags_self now handles determining if something with specific pass_flags
      can cross something, by default.
  - bugfix: 'piercing projectiles (see: penetrating snipers) work again'
  - tweak: projectile permutated/impacted list is reset on ricochets, meaning reflected
      projectiles can potentially hit something again if it pierced it the first time.

  Jared-Fogle:
  - rscadd: Dynamic now rolls a separate budget for round start and midround antagonists,
      meaning less round start antags will roll in favor of more midround ones.
  - admin: The antag_cap value now uses an equation that scales with population, rather
      than a fixed array.
  - admin: autotraitor_cooldown now uses deciseconds rather than ticks, so the older
      value of 450 now means 45 seconds. Set it to be 9000 if you want it to be accurate
      to the old value (15 minutes), or simply unset it.
  - admin: Midround/latejoin dynamic timers are now configurable.
  - admin: Syndicate Sleeper Agent will now give details when ti fails.
  - bugfix: The autotraitor cooldown now respects configuration, rather than resetting
      back to 15 minutes after it is rolled.
