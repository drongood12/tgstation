      in display.
  - refactor: Player panel logs will now show all logs chronologically, so you'll
      see commingled say and attack logs if you're on the "Show All" tab, etc...

  - bugfix: Cryogenics now properly update to pipenets and can work with HE setups.
  wesoda25:
  - bugfix: Bathhouse ruin now has proper walls
  zxaber:
  - balance: Cyborgs synced to a Malf AI that activates Doomsday will now have their
      lamps forced to a red color and enabled to at least light level one. Stealth
      is no longer an option. Lamp options return to normal upon Doomsday deactivation,
      no matter the reason, or if the borg somehow loses sync with the AI.
  - bugfix: Cell chargers will no longer powersink the room they're in, as they now
      draw all the power for the cell from the powernet directly through the APC.
      They still require a trickle of power on the equipment breaker, though.
