  ATHATH:
  - spellcheck: The shivering symptom has been renamed to be the "chills" symptom,
      per Cobby's request.
  - bugfix: The shivering/chills symptom now actually chills you like it says it does
      instead of heating you up. fix Safe chills and safe fever should now use an
      infectee's species's body temperature's actual cold and heat damage thresholds,
      instead of just using the default ones.
  - balance: Maxed out, unsafe chills and maxed out, unsafe fevers can now make you
      slightly colder or hotter than they could before, respectively.
  Arkatos:
  - code_imp: Space carps now use a new greyscaling system.
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue where space carps turned grey for a moment when attacking
      something.
  - qol: Light purple space carp variant is now more close to the original. Nostalgia!
  - qol: Replaced beige space carp variant with a light red one.
  KathyRyals:
  - balance: Thermal is now an active mutation, that has a cooldown and deals damage
      to your eyes.
  LemonInTheDark:
  - bugfix: Prayers will show a little book next to them again
  LemonInTheDark, duncathan:
  - refactor: Gas reactions should be cheaper in the standard case
  - refactor: Moves canisters, pipelines, and tanks to event based processing, if
      you see something fail to "update" when it really should let me know yeah?
  Mothblocks:
  - bugfix: Midround events will now properly poll again.

  maxymax13, /vg/station, Citadel Station:
  - imageadd: 3 new variations for wooden tiles are available (large, parquet, and
      tiled), the same way you color titanium tiles! Remember, use a screwdriver and
      not a crowbar!
  - imageadd: A new red planetary pattern design is available for arcade carpet!
  unit0016:
  - refactor: Cargo Shuttle consoles now rely a lot more on variables instead of hardcoding.
  vincentiusvin:
  - bugfix: The hotkey for dumping borg apparatus is now moved to Alt+Click instead
      of the nonfunctional Alt+Z. Right click for beaker apparatus spills reagent,
      just like with regular beakers. Z and self attack keeps the old interaction,
      it changes transfer volume.
