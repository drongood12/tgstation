  - code_imp: "A bunch of botany related things now use defines for their minimums and maximums."
  - code_imp: "Plants now almost entirely use the setter/adjuster procs to change their stats instead of doing it directly. Planted, spreading Growshrooms how have a minimum endurance of 10 instead of 0 as a consequence but they're functionally almost identical."
  - tweak: "Plant analyzers now show what graft you would get from a plant or seed, as well as the yield modifier a tray has."
  - tweak: "Plant analyzers now have a better description and examine text to show it as other modes you can switch it to."
  - tweak: "Plant analyzers now show the stats of grafts when you scan them in addition to their plant gene."
  - bugfix: "Inedible grown items now gain their chemicals properly after being harvested"
  - bugfix: "Inedible grown items now give out a proper analyzer readout on both modes"
  - bugfix: "Replica pods now give out the actual DNA they have in them instead of 'sampleDNA' on analyzing."
  - imageadd: "Rose sprites, Carbon Rose sprites, and a Rose Bouquet courtesy of Cybersaber101/blueshirtguy"
