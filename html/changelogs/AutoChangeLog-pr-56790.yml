  - tweak: "Similarly to how moth characters with the family heirloom quirk have a 50% chance to receive an old lantern as their family heirloom instead of one of their job's normal family heirloom items, felinids with the family heirloom quirk now have a 50% chance to receive a toy mouse as their family heirloom."
